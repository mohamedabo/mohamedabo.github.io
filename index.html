        <p>In 2014, I was offered a full tuition scholarship by Berea College located in Berea,KY.
           Berea College is the first coeducational college in the south. What makes this instituiton great
           is the work-study program that is offered to every student admitted. In addition to that, Berea college
           challenges its students constantly through its liberal arts education that improves the student's intellectual
           capabilities by requiring them to take classes outside of their major to be fully aware on other areas such as
           Psychology, Sociology and General Studies. Currently I work as a full stack developer
           at Berea College's web development team. My goal is to make a positive impact in my community and enhance the lives of people
            using the power of technology.
